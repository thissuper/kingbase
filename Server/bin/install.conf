# install.conf
# cluster deployment script configuration instructions:
#    path: in the same path as V8R3_cluster_install.sh.
#    parameter: colud be set in the config file, also could be set in V8R3_cluster_install.sh script(give priority to the configuration in this file).
#    constraints: 1. SSH encryption needs to be manually configured between the devices on which the script is run and the devices installed in the cluster, including between root users, ordinary users, root user and ordinary users.
#                 2. general-purpose computers can only be executed on ordinary users who are configured with SSH encryption, and BMJ can only be executed on root user, and all must be executed on the primary host.
#                 3. db.zip package decompression is completed at the directory level such as lib, bin, share, there can not be one more layer of directories in the middle, the directory like "kingbase/bin" can not be supported.
#                 4. automatic switching and automatic recovery are enabled by default, and md5 cluster is enabled by default.

# instructions:
#     if you are currently in BMJ, you need to ensure that all hosts have successfully installed the database and that es_server is in the startup state.
